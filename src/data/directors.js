For over two decades, I have dedicated myself to the art and craft of distilling, building a company rooted in trust, sustainability, and the empowerment of women. With pride, I lead a team where 80% of our workforce are women—strong, skilled, and passionate individuals who inspire excellence every day.

Today, I am thrilled to unveil the next milestone in our journey: Queens Crown, our very own whiskey brand in the luxury segment. More than just a spirit, Queens Crown is a tribute to elegance, strength, and craftsmanship—an ode to women who reign with grace and power.

This launch marks not only the culmination of years of dedication but also the beginning of a new legacy. With Queens Crown, we step proudly into the Indian market, offering a whiskey that embodies both heritage and luxury.`,

    note: `As the second generation stepping into this business, I am proud to carry forward my mother’s remarkable legacy in the world of bottling and distilling. What she built with passion, resilience, and vision has become a symbol of trust, sustainability, and women empowerment—and I am determined to take it to new horizons.

In a male-dominated industry, I see not obstacles but opportunities: to expand, innovate, and prove that women can lead with strength and vision. With our predominantly women-driven workforce, I aim to amplify empowerment while shaping a truly global presence for our brands.

It is with immense pride that I now lead our expansion with the launch of Queens Crown: a whiskey brand in the luxury segment that embodies our legacy of excellence, while charting a bold new future. Queens Crown is more than just a spirit; it is a statement of elegance, strength, and empowerment.

This is not just the next chapter of our company, it is the beginning of a new era, where legacy and innovation unite to leave a mark on the world stage.`,
